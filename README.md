# real-college-cost
App that calculates the total cost of college, not just tuition (currently work in progress!).

As someone who's tutored the SAT/ACT on the side for years now, I've always been invested in the lives of high school students.
When students are thinking about which college to attend, it can be easy to only take the cost of tuition into consideration. 
That's where RealCollegeCost comes in. Using this website, students can estimate the cost of their entire college experience, including
rent, food, textbooks, equipment, monthly subscriptions, even their spotify/netflix fees. Pulling data from college and cost of 
living apis, this website will do a lot of the estimating automatically, but students are always free to enter in their own custom 
amounts.
